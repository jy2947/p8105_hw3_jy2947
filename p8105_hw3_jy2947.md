    ## # ... with 1,384,607 more rows, and 9 more variables: order_number <int>,
    ## #   order_dow <int>, order_hour_of_day <int>,
    ## #   days_since_prior_order <int>, product_name <chr>, aisle_id <int>,
    ## #   department_id <int>, aisle <chr>, department <chr>

The data has information of some orders from customers, which includes the product information

-   the product names ordered by customers
-   the department of the product ordered by custormers
-   where is the product located in the inventory
-   has this product been reordered by this customer

and information about (what I define as) customer behavior

-   at what time of the day was the order placed
-   in what order was the products added into the cart
-   how often does the customer order from instacart

The key variables are `order_id` (which identifies each order), `product_id`(which identifies each item perchased by a user) and `user_id`(which identifies the user).
For example, row 1 to row 8 is a order placed by customer with the `user_id` 112108, each row is a product ordered by this custormer. This user mainly perchased diary and produce for daily comsumption, along with a bottle of canned seafood. This user order his(her) groceries at 10am. His(her) last order on instacard was 9 days ago, and he(she) has ordered some of the products before. This dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 variables.

To answer the questions:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle, aisle_id) %>% 
  summarize(n_aisle = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_aisle))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 3
    ## # Groups:   aisle [134]
    ##    aisle                         aisle_id n_aisle
    ##    <chr>                            <int>   <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables                    83  150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                        24  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits         123   78493
    ##  4 yogurt                             120   55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                     21   41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water      115   36617
    ##  7 milk                                84   32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                     107   31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                     91   26240
    ## 10 bread                              112   23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

So we have 134 aisles. People are ordering the most item from fresh vegetables, with `aisle_id = 83`.

for the first plot the idea now is to have several panels according to different departments. Within each department try the histogram for each aisle.
